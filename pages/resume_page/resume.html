                    In this summer student position at UBC, I wroked on developing automated exam questions for a
                    UBC data science course using Python and PrairieLearn; this project helped decrease the time it
                    took to grade exams, which made it easier on the professors and teaching assistants as well as
                    allowing students to get feedback sooner which studies show helps improve knowledge retention.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I was working with a team to develop these questions, using online collaboration tools such as
                    GitHub issues to ensure that development of questions went smoothly and code reviews were done
                    consistently.

                    In university, I studied computer science and was able to learn about a ton of things that
                    highly interested me. Topics such as machine architecture, parallel computing, and human
                    computer interaction were fascinating and I was amazed at the sheer depth of each of these
                    fields of study.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    During my studies, I worked on several notable projects. The first was a team assignment where I
                    organized a team of students to develop a basic tech support chatbot that worked using keyword
                    search of the user's input. The second, during a course focused on traditional AI, my team and I
                    created an AI that could play the "game of Amazons" which finished 3rd place in the final
                    tournament. Finally, during my degree's capstone project, my team and I created a scheduling
                    board web application for a local company. As the chief UI and UX designer for the project, I
                    designed the project's UI to be familiar to the company's employees by using skeuomorphic design
                    to recreate the workflow of their company's physical scheduling whiteboard and magnets. The
                    design received high praise for minimizing the learning curve and allowing the company to start
                    using the software straight away.
