                <h1>A bit about me:</h1>
                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Computer Science program at the University of British
                    Columbia. I'm passionate about UI design, have some experience developing websites, and I'm always looking for new ways to
                    improve my skills.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As a new graduate, I am currently experiencing the "joys" of job hunting. If you're interested in
                    hiring an amatuar-ish web developer, feel free to contact me!
                    <br />

                    Oh right, this site isn't close to being finished yet. I'm still working on it.
