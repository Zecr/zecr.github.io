                <p>
                    I'm a recent graduate from the Bachelor of Computer Science program at the University of British
                    Columbia. I'm passionate about UI design and development, and I'm always looking for new ways to
                    improve my skills.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    As a new graduate, I am currently experiencing the "joys" of job hunting. If you're interested in
                    hiring an amatuar-ish web developer, feel free to contact me!
