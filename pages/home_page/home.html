                    In a nutshell: I'm a recent UBC graduate, UI design enthusiast, lover of photography, "decent"
                    programmer, and a bit of a video game and anime nerd (but without the glasses).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you're reading this paragraph, it looks like the TL;DR version wasn't enough. In that case, I
                    suppose that I can also be called a web developer, experience designer, front-end programmer, or any
                    other somewhat related title that you can think of. As a recent graduate, I'm a jack of all trades,
                    but a master of none. I'm still learning and trying to find my place in this vast world of
                    technology.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But one thing that I can be confident in saying is that if I start work on a project that interests
                    me, you can bet that I will be putting in 110% of my effort into it.
                    <br />
