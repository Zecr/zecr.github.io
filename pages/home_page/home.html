                <p>
                    In a nutshell: I'm a computer science graduate, UI design enthusiast, lover of photography,
                    programmer, and a bit of a video game and anime nerd.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you're reading this paragraph, it looks like the "in a nutshell" version wasn't enough. In that
                    case, I suppose that I can also be called a web developer, experience designer, or front-end
                    programmer. I'm always looking to improve my skills so I'm following the latest technologies and
                    trends in the industry. Whether it be AI, new programming languages, interesting frameworks, or new design
                    patterns.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    One thing that I can be confident in, is that once I start work on a project that interests me, I
                    will be putting in 110% of my effort into it.
                    <!-- .. I suppose I'll need a reminder to maintain my work/life balance at that time. -->
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    So, that's a brief introduction of myself? Please have a look around this site. Or press "F11" then
                    "esc" to get a screen saver.
