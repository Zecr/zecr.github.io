                <p>
                    In a nutshell: I'm a computer science graduate, UI design enthusiast, lover of photography,
                    programmer, and a bit of a video game and anime nerd.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    If you're reading this paragraph, it looks like the "in a nutshell" version wasn't enough. In that
                    case, I suppose that I can also be called a web developer, experience designer, or front-end
                    programmer. I'm always looking to improve my skills so I'm following the latest technologies and
                    trends in the industry. Whether it be AI, new languages, interesting frameworks, or new design
                    patterns.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    But one thing that I can be confident in saying is that if I start work on a project that interests
                    me, you can bet that I will be putting in 110% of my effort into it.
                    <br />
