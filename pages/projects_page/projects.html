                    Hey look! The image is kind of like inception!

                    This website is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website, hopefully I did an adequate job.
                    It's quite simple and inexpensive in that it uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery and
                    HTMX) and it's hosted on GitHub Pages which is free to use.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I had quite a lot of fun designing the animations and layout of this site. I hope you like it as
                    well.

                <h1>Manpower Scheduling Board Web Application</h1>
                <p>
                    Ah yes, this is my computer science degree capstone project where we were tasked with creating a
                    scheduling board application for Horizon Electric Inc. to replace their manual "whiteboard and
                    magnets" method of scheduling employees. We decided to make the project web based, as it would be
                    easier to access using different types of devices and because my group were all familar with PHP
                    development due to a previous course we all took.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The project used PHP, MySQL, and Docker for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery)
                    for the frontend. Surprisingly, this project didn't use any major libraries or frameworks even
                    though the major workflow heavily emphasized drag and drop functionality and asynchronous updating
                    of elemnts (copilot, please stop)
