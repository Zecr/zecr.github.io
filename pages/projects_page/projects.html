                    Hey look! It's the webpage you're currently on!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This website is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website. Built using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript (with jQuery and HTMX) with hosting provided by GitHub Pages.

                    <br />
                    I had a lot of fun designing the animations and layout of this site. I hope you like it as well.

                <h1>Manpower Scheduling Board Web Application</h1>
                <p>
                    My computer science degree capstone project where we were tasked with creating a scheduling board
                    application for Horizon Electric Inc. to replace their manual "whiteboard and magnets" method of
                    scheduling employees. We decided to make the project web based, as it would be easier to access
                    using different types of devices and because my group were all familiar with PHP development due to
                    a previous course we all took.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The project used PHP, MySQL, and Docker for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery)
                    for the frontend. Surprisingly, this project didn't use any major libraries or frameworks even
                    though the major workflow heavily emphasized drag and drop functionality and asynchronous updating
                    of elements.
