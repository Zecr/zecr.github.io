                    Hey look! It's the webpage you're currently on!

                    <br />
                    This website is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website. Built using HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript (with jQuery and HTMX) with hosting provided by GitHub Pages. Unfortunately, github pages
                    introduces some limitations, such as having no server-side functionality, so no interactive game and
                    leaderboard... yet.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I had a lot of fun designing the animations and layout of this site. I hope you like it as well.

                <h1>Manpower Scheduling Board Web Application</h1>
                <p>
                    My computer science degree capstone project where we were tasked with creating a scheduling board
                    application for Horizon Electric Inc. to replace their manual "whiteboard and magnets" method of
                    scheduling employees. We decided to make the project web based, as it would be easier to access
                    using different types of devices and because my group were all familiar with PHP development due to
                    a previous course we all took.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The project used PHP, MySQL, and Docker for the backend, and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery)
                    for the frontend. Surprisingly, this project didn't use any major libraries or frameworks even
                    though the major workflow heavily emphasized drag and drop functionality and asynchronous updating
                    of elements.

                <h1>VR Support Chatbot</h1>
                <p>
                    This project was completed during a university course that focused on Software Engineering. To get
                    us familiarized with the project development lifecycle, our professor arranged students into teams
                    and had us create a chatbot. As large language models wasn't invented yet, and even if they were we
                    didn't have the resources to train one, I decided to use keyword search to mimic intelligence and
                    have the bot output a set of pre-written messages based on the user's input.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The project was written in Java, with some features utilizing third-party .jar files or external
                    APIs. One of these features was spelling correction so that our bot won't be tripped up by a user
                    mistyping a keyword. Another one of these features was a translation function that let the bot
                    converse with the user no matter which language the user preferred. I also decided to add in email
                    integration too, where the bot is able to send emails to facilitate "returns" of the VR product once
                    the user has completed all troubleshooting steps.
