                    This website is my first attempt at creating a portfolio website. I wanted to create a website that
                    would be simple, and inexpensive. It is simple in that it uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (with jQuery and
                    HTMX), Inexpensive in that it is hosted on GitHub
                    Pages which is free to use.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I had quite a lot of fun designing the animations and layout of this site. I hope you like it as well.
